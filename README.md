A simple 5-letter word guessing game in Python inspired by Wordle.

# Word Guessing Game (Wordle-style)

This is a simple command-line Python game where the user has to guess a hidden 5-letter word within a limited number of attempts. After each guess, the program provides feedback:

- `#` – Correct letter in the correct position
- `*` – Correct letter in the wrong position
- `-` – Letter not in the word at all

The game logic is inspired by Wordle but implemented in Python using basic loops and string operations. Great for beginners learning conditionals, loops, and string handling.

## Features
- Validates user input to ensure 5-letter guesses
- Handles repeated letters correctly
- Gives feedback after each guess
- Simple and easy to read code

Requirements
